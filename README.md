## An Android application designed for group gift exchanges.


Make a gift exchanging easy. With giftX, now it's very simple to gather a group of friends, family or co-workers to and have it handle all the exchange assignments.

####giftX provides users with a blacklist capability. 

What that means: 

We know not every one gets along during a gift exchange. Maybe there's a co-worker you'd rather steer clear of or a family member you've never heard of. With each user's blacklist, you can add participants from a group & once the official sorting date arrives, you will be assigned someone not in your blacklist.* 

####How does giftX work:
+ Each user is required to create an account. Only an email & password are required. (Google Login provided for easy account creation)

+ From the main page, a user is able to create various groups for friends, co-workers, etc.

+ Each group is required a start date & a sort date. During the period in between, Admin users are given access to change the sorting date, add new participants, and to add memos for all participants. 

+ Each user has their own profile which they can use to add a quick bio, photo, likes & dislikes. This profile is given to the participant that has you as an assignment.

+ Profiles are kept private, only the people who you've been assigned to can view it.

+ Once the sorting date is reached, giftX will handle the personal assignments, while taking each participant's blacklist.

+ giftX aims to make the little things easy and efficient for all participants.

**There is certain edge cases where the sorting assignment can be someone chosen in the blacklist*
